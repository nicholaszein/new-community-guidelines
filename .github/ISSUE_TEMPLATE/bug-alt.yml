              - *️⃣ **All fields in this form are required** — no exceptions. <br>Incomplete issues will be closed without further action.

              - 🔍 **Search for similar issues before opening a new one.** <br>Avoid duplicates and save time by **[using the filters at the top of the Issues list](https://github.com/nicholaszein/new-community-guidelines/issues)** to narrow your search.

              - 🆕 **Ensure you have the latest stable versions installed.** <br>Including Elementor, Elementor Pro, WordPress core, your active theme, and all installed plugins. <br>👉 Stay updated: **[Elementor Changelogs](https://elemn.to/changelog)**

              - 🗑️ **Clear all relevant cache layers.** <br>Confirm the issue is not being caused by stale or cached data. <br>Please clear server cache, site-level cache (including plugin-based cache), CDN cache, and your browser cache — in that order.

              - 🕵️ **Test with only Elementor, Elementor Pro, and the Hello Theme active.** <br>Temporarily disable all other plugins and themes. This step helps confirm that the issue is not being caused by a 3rd-party conflict. <br>👉 Reference: **[Troubleshooting the Editor](https://elemn.to/help-troubleshooting)**

              - 💾 **Copy and paste your complete Elementor System Info.** <br>This is not optional and helps us better reproduce and understand your issue.

              - ☝️ **Only one issue per report.** <br>Please don't bundle multiple bugs in a single submission. This helps us track, reproduce, and fix each issue accurately.

              ## 📝 Instructions

              To help us understand and resolve your issue, please follow these best practices:

              - ✒️ **Use a clear and descriptive title.** <br>A good title helps everyone quickly understand what the issue is about. Try to summarize the problem in a few words.

              - 💬 **Describe the issue in detail.** <br>Include as much context as you can. What happened? When did it start? What page or feature does it affect? <br>Feel free to attach screenshots or screen recordings — just drag and drop them into the text field when filling out the form.

              - 👣 **List all steps to reproduce the issue.** <br>Be specific! We need to follow the exact steps you took to reproduce the issue — ideally on a clean WordPress installation. <br>Reports without clear reproduction steps may be closed, as we cannot fix what we cannot replicate.

              - 🧠 **Explain what you expected to happen.** <br>Help us understand what you believe the correct or intended behavior should be.
