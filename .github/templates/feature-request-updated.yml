              To increase the chances of your request being selected for implementation, please ensure your Feature Request meets the following requirements.
              </summary>

              - 🔍 **Search for similar Feature Requests before opening a new one.** <br>Avoid duplicates and save time by **[using the filters at the top of the Feature Requests list](https://github.com/nicholaszein/new-community-guidelines/discussions/categories/feature-request)** to narrow your search.
              - 🗳️ **Vote for existing Feature Requests.** <br>Instead of opening a new discussion or writing "+1", use the Upvote button to express your interest in suggested features. The most voted Feature Requests are more likely to be considered for implementation in future versions.
              - ☝️ **Only one request per discussion.** <br>Please don't bundle multiple Feature Requests in a single submission. This helps us track and prioritize features that the majority of users are interested. Discussions with bundled requests won't be considered for implementation.
